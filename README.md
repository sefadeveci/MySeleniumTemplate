# Selenium Template

This project is my generic Selenium Template for using Selenium scripts. Basically I'm not only using Selenium for test automation, but also web scraping. So I need a template for working different locations/systems.

Note that this template does not include test report tools/Jira integration and does not include any screenshot capabilities. Cuz I try different tools and different approach every project for this points. You can definitely include your personal integration code blocks.
